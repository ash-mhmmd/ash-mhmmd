# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ashli Mohammad, an aspiring data analyst. I'm currently in a customer service role which actually involves much of what a data analyst's would and I'm looking to move to a formal analyst position.

I like to spend much of my free time learning new things and developing my skills in data analysis and visualizations. I especially enjoy working with:
* SQL / MySQL
* Tableau
* Power BI

I'm currently working on improving in the above areas as well as stepping into R and Python.
